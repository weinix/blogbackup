给岚迪思医生办公室打电话，听了十分钟音乐后让我留言。一小时后，护士莎柔回了电话。
 
...
&quot;Hi Mr. Wang, this is Sheryl from Dr. Landis's office. I've got your message. What can I do for you?&quot;
 
&quot;My wife and two sons are in China right now. And my son Chen is suspected having chickenpox or measles. He has seen three doctors and they gave different diagnoses, which is quite frustrating. So I'd like to have some suggestions from you. &quot;
 
&quot;OK&quot;

&quot;Basically Chen had rashes on his hands and feet for around one week then he had fever for two days. After the fever, the rash turned to small blisters and he also got a painful mouth ulcer.&quot;
 
&quot;Rashes are very difficult to be diagnosed without seeing the patient. Since he is in China, I am afraid we can't do much about it.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, from the symptoms I've told you. It doesn’t sound like measles, doest it? One of the doctors said its measles.&quot;
 
&quot;It doesn't sound like measles. It doesn't sound like chickenpox either, since the rashes are only on hands and feet, normally chickenpox starts from stomach and then over the body. It more looks like mouth and hand foot disease to me. But again, without seeing him I can't really tell you more.&quot;
 
&quot;I understand. In case of chickenpox, is there anything we should do to our younger son Daniel as he has been in physical contact with Chen? &quot;
 
&quot;There is not really anything you can do now since he is already exposed to him. And it's virus, there is no effective medicine you can use as well. Again, I don't know what else I can tell you without seeing him.&quot;
 
&quot;Okay.. Thanks for your time.&quot;
 
&quot;Bye&quot;
 
&quot;Bye&quot;
