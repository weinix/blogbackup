**吃晚饭的时候，打开电视，TNT台在放阿甘正传。**

**这是我看过最多遍的电影，二十遍？三十遍？甚至四十遍？记不清了。**

**那时候，一个人跑来跑去为稻粱谋，随身带著红兰宝书和一个便携的VCD机，几盘电影碟，这盘阿甘正传总会在。无聊时看，寂寞时看，沮丧时看。**

**最感动阿甘为允Bubba一诺而去捕虾。当时喜欢的高晓松作品集的文案里有一句话：再也没有为允一诺而独行万里的朋友。**

**Forrest Gump:** I can't help it; I love you Jenny.
**Jenny:** Forrest, you don't know what love is.

* * *

**Forrest:** Mama always said, dying was a part of life.

* * *

**Forrest:** Will you marry me Jenny?
**Jenny:** You don't wanna marry me, Forrest.

* * *

**Forrest Gump:** Mama says they was magic shoes. They could take me anywhere.

* * *

**Lieutenant Dan:** Have you found God yet, Gump?
**Forrest Gump:** I didn't know I was supposed to be looking for him.

* * *

**Forrest Gump:** Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?
**Lieutenant Dan:** I'm here to try out my sea legs.
**Forrest Gump:** But you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan.

* * *

**Jenny:** Do you think I could fly off this bridge, Forrest?
**Forrest:** What do you mean , Jenny?
**Jenny:** Nothing.

* * *

**Forrest:** Mama always said life was like a box a chocolates, never know what you're gonna get.

* * *

**Drill Sergeant**: Gump! Why did you put that weapon together so quickly, Gump?
**Forrest Gump:** You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

* * *

**Bubba:** Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it.

* * *

**Bubba:** Have you ever been on a real shrimping boat?
**Forrest:** No, but I've been on a real big boat.

* * *

**Forrest Gump:** Now you wouldn't believe me if I told you, but I could run like the wind blows. From that day on, if I was ever going somewhere, I was running!!

* * *

**Forrest Gump:** Stupid is as stupid does.

* * *

**Forrest Gump:** Sometimes, there just aren't enough rocks.

* * *

**Drill Sergeant**: Gump! What's your sole purpose in this army?
**Forrest Gump:** To do whatever you tell me, drill sergeant!
**Drill Sergeant**: God damn it, Gump! You're a god damn genius! This is the most outstanding answer I have ever heard. You must have a goddamn I.Q. of 160\. You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump.

* * *

**Forrest Gump:** I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.

* * *

**Forrest Gump:** We were like peas and carrots, Jenny and I.

* * *

**Forrest Gump:** I'm sorry for ruining your party, Lieutenant Dan. She tasted of cigarettes.

* * *

**Forrest:** What's his name?
**Jenny:** Forrest. I named him after his daddy.
**Forrest:** He's got a daddy named Forrest just like me?
**Jenny:** Forrest, you are his daddy.

* * *

**Forrest:** I ran for three years, two months, fourteen days and sixteen hours. When I was hungry, I ate. When I was tired, I slept. When I had to go, you know, I went!

* * *

**Lt. Venetti**: So where are you boys from?
Forrest Gump, **Benjamin &quot;Bubba&quot; Bufford-Blue**: Alabama, sir!
**Lt. Venetti**: You guys twins or something?
**Forrest Gump:** No sir, we are not relations.
